# Description
This is NYU Tandon ME-GY 6923 Simulation Tools for Mechatronics and Robotics Fall 2021 semester group final project.  

This project intends to design a quadcopter simulation and control program using MathWorks newest package delivery quadcopter model.  

Quadcopter will perform wind disturbance rejection, altitude and attitude maintenance.    

The model was developed based on:  [Package Delivery Quadcopter](https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sm/ug/quadcopter.html)
